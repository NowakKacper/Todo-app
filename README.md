# Todo-app
Todo App is a simple, intuitive and highly useful way to organize your everyday life.
Using this application, I learned how to create web applications, so you can find different solutions for one thing in it. In this program I used Spring JPA and learned how to create enjces and save them to the database. The stored data is processed using services and then used in controllers to display appropriate data on the website to the user. In app there are also events thanks to which all changes in task statuses are registered in the database and thanks to this we can take interesting informations. The user interface is simple and offers many options such as adding a project, group or individual tasks and displaying all existing ones. I am currently adding security to the application using Spring Security, which I am learning, and additional options are being added in the user interface.
